## Edge-IIoTset

Primary full archive:

```

Extracted CSV/PDF/README subset:

```text
data/raw/edgeiiotset/full/
```

Convenience symlinks:

```text
data/raw/edgeiiotset/full_dataset
data/raw/edgeiiotset/DNN-EdgeIIoT-dataset.csv
data/raw/edgeiiotset/ML-EdgeIIoT-dataset-full.csv
```

Extracted contents:

- `Attack traffic/*.csv`: 14 attack CSV files.
- `Normal traffic/<sensor>/*.csv`: 10 normal sensor/source CSV files.
- `Selected dataset for ML and DL/DNN-EdgeIIoT-dataset.csv`: 2,219,202 lines.
- `Selected dataset for ML and DL/ML-EdgeIIoT-dataset.csv`: 157,801 lines.
- `Edge_IIoTset__DatasetFL.pdf`
- `Readme.txt`

Notes:

- PCAP files were intentionally not extracted. The archive still contains them.
- The full CSV extraction preserves file/source structure for file/source-aware splits.
- A smaller Kaggle mirror was also downloaded under `data/raw/kagglehub/datasets/sibasispradhan/edge-iiotset-dataset/versions/2`; it contains selected CSVs only.
- A public GitHub mirror of `ML-EdgeIIoT-dataset.csv` was downloaded at `data/raw/edgeiiotset/ML-EdgeIIoT-dataset.csv` for quick sanity checks.

- Fed-SB official private federated reproduction.
- Sanity-checking privacy/accounting code before Edge-IIoTset migration.

## Processed Artifacts

Prepared artifacts:

Generation command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/prepare_datasets.py \
  --edge-root data/raw/edgeiiotset/full_dataset \
  --snli-root data/raw/snli/current \
  --out-dir data/processed \
  --count-rows \
  --relative-paths
```

Generated Edge-IIoTset summary:

- File manifest: 26 CSV files: 14 attack files, 10 normal source files, 2 selected merged files.
- Source-aware split seed: `20260531`.
- Source-aware split sizes: 16 train sources, 2 validation sources, 6 test sources.
- Excluded from source-aware split: `DNN` and `ML` selected merged files, because they no longer preserve original file/source boundaries.
- Prompt smoke samples: 32 JSONL examples from `Selected dataset for ML and DL/ML-EdgeIIoT-dataset.csv`.
- Label inventory: 15 normalized labels.
- Main selected-ML stratified split seed: `20260531`.
- Main selected-ML split sizes: 126,233 train rows, 15,774 validation rows, 15,793 test rows.
- Main simulated FL client partition: `K=10`, Dirichlet label-skew `alpha=0.5`, generated from the selected-ML training split.
- Main paper protocol uses the selected-ML stratified split and K=10 Dirichlet client partition. The source-aware split is a robustness/diagnostic artifact, not the primary Qwen3.5-2B experiment split.

Label normalization currently applied:

```text
OS_Fingerprinting -> Fingerprinting
```

This is necessary because the raw `Attack traffic/OS_Fingerprinting_attack.csv` file uses `OS_Fingerprinting`, while both selected merged CSVs use `Fingerprinting`.
